    "**Situation**: In my last year of university, the Syrian war was probably the most covered news topic on media. I founded a startup that gives free smartphones with preloaded applications to the disadvantaged. What does this mean? I wanted to give refugees free phones that helped bridge the gap between solutions and delivery. There have been soo many new and cool solutions to help aid people in need but the biggest problems we see are that they fail to reach its intended audience. I wanted to fix this. I wanted to give people the chance to survive and thrive in crisis. There have been countless discussions on \"Do you actually know what it is that they would need or want on a handheld device?\" As simple as this question is, there has been a huge gap in obtaining data for everyone who falls into difficulties, especially refugees and people who fall below the poverty line. My phones would also help to collect data in an ethical way. <br>\n",

    "## Enterprise Software v SaaS\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting new association management software, you will often have to choose between “enterprise” software and software-as-a-service (SAAS). In the traditional definition, enterprise software is software your organization buys and installs on your organization’s servers. By contrast, SaaS software is software that you “rent” and is hosted “in the cloud” and accessed via the internet. In addition and significantly, SaaS offerings tend to be multi-tenant, meaning that multiple organizations are actually working in the same database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SO WHAT ARE THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO TYPES OF SOFTWARE? HERE ARE FOUR DISTINGUISHING FACTORS** : <br> \n",
    "**Customizability**  – One of the primary advantages of traditional enterprise software is the ability to customize the software. Because you own the software, you can customize the software as needed to address your needs. With SaaS software, customization is typically limited to whatever tools the SaaS provider offers (e.g., creating new fields, creating new entities, or nothing at all). Because a SaaS offering is typically in a multi-tenant environment  pure customization is simply not possible (since customizing would, by definition, change the database being used by other organizations). Advantage: Enterprise <br> \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "**Querying and Reporting** – Because SaaS offerings are multi-tenant, creating queries and reports presents a challenge. Queries and reports typically scan the entire database for data, which means in a multi-tenant environment, queries and reports can create a lot of processing overhead. This will affect other organizations sharing the database, and thus SaaS offerings tend to limit the kind of querying and reporting available to the user. By contrast, in an enterprise setting, querying and reporting can be done with third-party tools via ODBC, or the data sets can be pulled and reformatted in a data warehouse. Advantage: Enterprise <br> \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "**Functionality** – This is somewhat related to issue #1 above. Because of limited customizability, a SaaS system may not be able to perform all of the functionality your organization requires. In theory, at least, an enterprise system can be customized to address all of your functional needs. Advantage: Enterprise <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Price/Cash Flow** – Enterprise pricing tends to follow this model: software licensing, software maintenance, and customization/services. SaaS pricing tends to follow this model: monthly fee and services. Because you are purchasing software at the enterprise level (rather than renting, as in the SaaS model), your initial costs will be much, much higher, sometimes by a factor of 100 or more. The result is that initial costs for SaaS software will be significantly lower than enterprise software. Over time (typically 5 to 7 years) the total cost of ownership for SaaS and enterprise software will converge. But for SaaS offerings, that cost is spread over 7 years, rather than being frontloaded into the first year. Advantage: SaaS [Effective Database management](https://effectivedatabase.com/the-difference-between-enterprise-software-and-software-as-a-service/#:~:text=The%20Difference%20Between%20Enterprise%20Software%20and%20Software%2Das%2Da%2DService,-When%20selecting%20new&text=In%20the%20traditional%20definition%2C%20enterprise,and%20accessed%20via%20the%20internet.)"

    "**AND WHAT ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION? AGAIN, THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SAAS AND ENTERPRISE OFFERINGS**: <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Data conversion** SaaS implementations tend to be simpler and thus the data conversion process is usually more condensed. That is, the standard process for SaaS data conversion is to convert the data once and to convert only baseline information (e.g., contact info, membership info). More detailed data imports can be done but are typically outside the norm. With enterprise-level implementations, there may be two or more iterations of data conversion, and they may contain very broad sets of data (e.g., financial data, event attendance history, product purchase history, etc.). <br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Testing** With an enterprise system there are typically many configurations and customizations set up and thus testing becomes extremely important, to ensure the system works as designed. With SaaS offerings, the processes tend to be baked in and thus testing is much less intensive. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Training** Enterprise systems tend to include several days of onsite training, while SaaS offerings tend to provide online/on-demand training. Onsite training tends to provide for more in-depth discussion of issues and may be more focused on organization-specific needs, while on-demand training is, by definition, much more generic, Of course, on-demand training is available whenever you need it.<br>\n"

    "**Mobile backend as a service (MBaaS)** , also known as \"backend as a service\",[1][2][3] is a model for providing web app and mobile app developers with a way to link their applications to backend cloud storage and APIs exposed by back end applications while also providing features such as user management, push notifications, and integration with social networking services.[4] These services are provided via the use of custom software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs). BaaS is a relatively recent development in cloud computing,[5] with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later.[6][7][8] Although a fairly nascent industry, trends indicate that these services are gaining mainstream traction with enterprise consumers.[9] [BaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_backend_as_a_service)\n",
    "**BaaS is distinct from these other services in that it specifically addresses the cloud-computing needs of web and mobile app developers by providing a unified means of connecting their apps to cloud services.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Each BaaS provider offers a slightly different set of backend tools and resources.[10] Among the most common services provided are notification service, file storage and sharing, integration with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, location services, database persistence and queries, messaging and chat functions, user management, running business logic, and usage analysis tools.[15][16]\n",
    "\n",
    "BaaS providers have a broad focus, providing SDKs and APIs that work for app development on multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone, HTML5, and others.[16]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business model** \n",
    "BaaS providers generate revenue from their services in various ways, often using a freemium model. Under this model, a client receives a certain number of free active users or API calls per month, and pays a fee for each user or call over this limit. Alternatively, clients can pay a set fee for a package which allows for a greater number of calls or active users per month.[11] There are also flat fee plans that make the pricing more predictable. Some of the providers offer the unlimited API calls inside their free plan offerings.[17] While BaaS is most commonly offered as a commercial service, open Source options are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This meant that \n",
    "\n",
    "** Reason for choosing SaaS ** \n",
    "**Ease of installation/ease of upgrade** For a typical SaaS offering, the database software itself is installed and ready to run the instant you sign the contract. Obviously data conversion, setup, and training has to occur in order to use the software, but installation is a non-issue. Related to that, upgrades are pushed out automatically to all users, which means upgrades occur and with little fanfare and no effort on the part of the user organization. In addition, a SaaS offering requires no “maintenance” or tuning on the part of the client.**Super Quick** <br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**The benefits don’t justify the costs** Even though enterprise software offers more functionality (speaking broadly) than SaaS offerings, for many organizations, these advantages are not significant enough to justify the higher initial expense and greater maintenance overhead required of an enterprise system.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Cash flow** For many organizations, the largest single purchase the organization will make is their data management system. For a smaller association (e.g., 15 staff), at the enterprise level this could mean a first year investment of over 150,000. For a SaaS with similar functionality, the first year investment might be closer to 30,000. From a cash flow perspective, that’s a huge difference. And if an organization that does not have significant reserves (or is uncomfortable tapping those reserves), a $150,000 investment may simply be untenable.   \n",

Here, your licensor is essentially a consumer of your product and you may charge them either a fixed usage fee or one based on consumption. If your licensor is in the same line of business as you (Getty Images, for example), then charging them a percentage of the revenue is ideal. This way, the licensee makes money each time their content is sold by a third party licensor.\n",
