# dspractice
This will be a repo that will help anyone practice their data science skills. It will start off with the basics of coding and build up to statistical analysis and machine learning models. This will be a good quick run through of all that it taught at Flatiron school. 


There are usually 2 parts to most technical interviews: 
 1. Conversational 
 2. Coding 
 
The first part, conversational requires a walk through of a project that one has done. There will be open ended questions on what project a person has done. This will require one to go into detail about any obstacles that the person has come across and the steps taken to overcome the problem(s). 
 
It is important to think critically with how you walk through your project. Ask yourself: 
    What steps did you take?
    Why did you take them?
    What was your reasoning?
    Remember to break everything down.

For the conversational part of a technical interview, take 3 projects that one has conducted and write them down step by step and answer the three questions above. 

There will almost always be probability and statistics questions, questions on how to write specific code and a case study. 

Statistics and how to write specific code usually falls into the conversational category. Employers want to see that you're able to communicate code clearly and if you can actually do it on the top of your head. 

The coding part of a technical interview usually challenges and tests one's ability on writing code, but most importantly problem solving. This can also be a take home project and or testing execution. 

This repo will have at least 2 separate noteboos. 

1. Conversational: 
    This will include any and all questions that we can think of that has to do with probability and statistics as well as being able to walk through machine learning models. 
    
2. Coding: 
    This will include questions on how to build nested loops, merge data frames and problems that more complex.
    
All of the practice questions will come from common sources that I will list below:
